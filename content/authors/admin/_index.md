Hi, I'm **Davis**! I am a sociologist at the University of Michigan who studies wealth and social mobility. My research investigates how population-level inequalities are reinforced by family-level dynamics---unfolding across multiple generations of families.

I am currently working on two broader projects. The first explores how the timing of childhood poverty contributes to intergenerational inequality. And the second examines the wealth accumulation process and society's larger shift in the reliance on household finances as a *de facto* safety net.

Outside of work, I love laughing and walking. I enjoy consuming pop culture and spicy food. And I'm a big fan of opening 40 tabs of *New Yorker* articles, admitting defeat, and then closing 38 tabs of *New Yorker* articles.
