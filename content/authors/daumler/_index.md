Hi, I am a sociologist who studies wealth, poverty, and families---in order to understand how societies become economically and racially stratified.

In my dissertation, I investigate large and meaningful questions about how the temporality of life experiences contributes to new and existing forms of social stratification. This project consists of two lines of research. First, I study the life-course dynamics of childhood poverty. Second, I study the historical dynamics of family wealth accumulation.

Taken together, my work generates sociological explanations for how the temporal dynamics of families accumulate into generational inequalities.
